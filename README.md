# AimAssistUsingAi
Welcome to AimAssistUsingAI, a university project aimed at automating the aiming mechanism in popular games like CS:GO, Valorant, Apex Legends, and more. By utilizing advanced image recognition and neural networks.
# Project Description
The YOLOv5 model is employed to detect and mark enemies on the screen, identifying their precise locations. Once the closest target is determined, the program calculates the distance between your crosshair and the target. Our GAN neural network then generates smooth, human-like mouse movement trajectories, guiding your aim naturally and accurately.
# To run the project
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
Python 3.9,
Pytorch,
